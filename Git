Your accidentally committed sensitive credentials to public GitHub repo
- what steps will you take immediately?

 1. Remove the Credentials from the Repo

   git rm --cached <file-with-secret>

 2. Force Push the Cleaned Repo

    git push origin --force --all  Force push all local branches to remote

 3.Check for Clones

 4.Notify Your Team

---------------------------------------------------------

Your git repository becomes very messy with many unnecessary commits
- how do you clean it up?

 1. Use Interactive Rebase

   This helps you squash or remove unwanted commits
   git rebase -i HEAD~N

   Change pick to squash or drop to merge or remove commits.
 
 2. Reset to Clean State (Caution)

   git reset --hard <commit_id>

 3. Clean Up Local Branches

   git branch -d <branch-name>

---------------------------------------------------------

You pushed code to the wrong branch - how would you fix it?

1. Switch to the Correct Branch
2. Cherry-pick or Merge the Commit(s)
   
   git cherry-pick <commit_id>
   git merge <wrong-branch>

3. Push the Correct Branch

4. Undo the Push on the Wrong Branch
   
   git checkout <wrong-branch>
   git reset --hard origin/<wrong-branch>  # reset to remote state
   git push --force

---------------------------------------------------------

How would you setup a Git workflow to support multiple
teams working on the same codebase?

 1. Branching Strategy
 2. Pull Requests (PRs)

---------------------------------------------------------

You need to rollback your repository to a previous 
stable commit - what's your process?

git reset --hard <commit_id>
git push --force              (commit in the local repository)

git revert <commit_id>        (commit in the remote repository)

---------------------------------------------------------

how would you find out who made a specific change in a code file 3 months ago?

1. git blame

   git blame <file-name>
   git blame -L 10,20 <file-name>  # lines 10 to 20
   git blame -L 15,15 <file-name>


2. Use git log with --since

   git log --since="3 months ago" <file-name>

   git log -L <start>,<end>:<file-name>

---------------------------------------------------------

How do you squash commits before merging into the main branch?

1. Checkout the Feature Branch

   git checkout feature-branch


2. Rebase Interactively
   
   Use interactive rebase to squash commits:

   git rebase -i HEAD~3

   This opens a list of your commits since the branch diverged from main.

3.Change pick to squash

  Keep the first commit as pick

  Change the rest to squash (or s)

  pick  abc123  Add login feature
  squash def456  Fix typo in login
  squash ghi789  Clean up login code

4. Push with Force

  git push origin feature --force

5. Merge into Main

   git checkout main
   git merge feature-branch
   git push origin main

---------------------------------------------------------

A teammate stuck with a detached HEAD state - 
How would you help them recover?

1. Check Current State

  First, confirm they're in a detached HEAD state:

  git status

  The output will say something like:

  HEAD detached at <commit-hash>

2. Recover Their Work

   If your teammate made changes in this state and wants to keep them, they should:

   Option 1: Create a New Branch
   Create a new branch from the current commit to save their changes:

   git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

   Option 2: Checkout the Original Branch

   If they want to return to their original branch:

   git checkout <original-branch-name>
  
  This will move them back to the branch they were working on before entering the detached HEAD state

3. If They Made Changes in Detached HEAD

  If they made commits but didn't create a branch, use:

  git log

  Find the commit hash of their work, and then:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name> <commit-hash>

  This will create a new branch from their commit and recover their work.

4. Explain the Cause
   
   A detached HEAD happens when they checkout a specific commit, tag, or remote branch directly (without creating a branch). It's a good idea to always create a new branch for changes.


---------------------------------------------------------
1.Cherry Pick

Got it 👍 You have:

main branch

feature1 branch with one commit (ID = 12345)
You want to:

Cherry-pick that commit (12345) into main

Remove that commit from feature1

Push the updated main to the remote repository

Here’s the step-by-step Git command example 👇

Step 1: Switch to the main branch

git checkout main


Step 2: Cherry-pick the commit from feature1

git cherry-pick 12345

✅ This copies the commit (ID 12345) from feature1 to main.

If there are merge conflicts, fix them and then:

git add .
git cherry-pick --continue


Step 3: Push the main branch to remote

git push origin main
✅ Now your remote main branch has that commit.

🧩 Step 4: Remove the commit from feature1
Now go back to the feature1 branch:

git checkout feature1

Then use reset to remove the last commit (12345):

git reset --hard HEAD~1
⚠️ This will permanently delete that commit from the feature1 branch.

If that commit was not the last one, use:

git log

Find the commit just before 12345, and reset to that:

git reset --hard <commit_id_before_12345>

🧩 Step 5: Push changes to remote feature1 branch (force needed)

Because you rewrote history, you must force-push:

git push origin feature1 --force

---------------------------------------------------------

# Cherry-pick commit to main
git checkout main
git cherry-pick 12345
git push origin main

# Remove commit from feature1
git checkout feature1
git reset --hard HEAD~1 (If it is last commit in the feature1 branch)
git reset --hard <commit_id_before_12345>
git push origin feature1 --force

---------------------------------------------------------

2. To fix the brocken commit or to modify the last commit message

# On main branch
git checkout main

# Fix last commit message
git commit --amend
git commit --amend -m "Fix Kubernetes deployment configuration"

# Push to remote (force if already pushed before)
git push origin main --force

---------------------------------------------------------

3. Merge feature4 with feature3 and delete the feature4 branch

git fetch origin
git checkout feature3
git pull origin feature3
git merge feature4
# resolve conflicts if any, then:
# git add <resolved-files>
# git commit   # if needed
git push origin feature3

# delete local branch (safe)
git branch -d feature4

# delete remote branch
git push origin --delete feature4

---------------------------------------------------------
4. squash the 3 commits on feature6 into a single commit, 
   then merge that single commit into main and push main to the remote.

git checkout feature6
git fetch origin
git pull --rebase origin feature6
git rebase -i HEAD~3       # squash in editor
# resolve any rebase conflicts, finish rebase

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature6         # merges the single squashed commit
git push origin main

---------------------------------------------------------
5.Squash the last three commits in feature6 branch and 
  merge with main branch

git checkout feature6
git fetch origin
git pull --rebase origin feature6
git rebase -i HEAD~3       # squash in editor
# resolve any rebase conflicts, finish rebase
git push origin feature6 --force

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature6         # merges the single squashed commit
git push origin main
