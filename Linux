Linux kernel is the core component of the linux operating system, managing system resources and providing communication between hardware and software.

A hard link acts as copy of the selected file.It aceess the data available in the original file.
If the earlier selected file is deleted, the hard link to the file will still contain the data of that file.

A soft link acts as a pointer or reference to  the filename.It does not access the data available in the original file.
If the earlier selected file is deleted, the soft link to the file that does not exit any more.

An inode is a datastructure, that keeps track of all files and directories in a linux file system,So every file and directory in a file system is allocated an inode, which is identified by an integer known as Inode number.

Swap memory is also known as swap space or virtual memory.Swap memory is a space on the storage device that the operating system uses as virtual memory when physical RAM is full, when RAM is full inactive pages of the memory are moved to swap space,freeing up physical space for active processes.

A shell is a command line interface that allows users to interact with linux operating system.

Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a command-line interpreter and scripting language for Unix-based systems, used to execute commands, automate tasks, and manage system processes.

ll -- long list -- To see the all files and directories permissions

File and Directory Permissions in Linux

In Linux, every file and directory has permissions that control who can read, write, or execute them. These permissions are categorized into three groups:

Owner (User) – The creator of the file/directory.

Group – A set of users who share access.

Others – Everyone else.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Each permission is represented using three characters:

r (read)(4) → View the contents of a file or list a directory.

w (write)(2) → Modify a file or create/delete files in a directory.

x (execute)(1) → Run a file as a program or access a directory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Permission Representation

Permissions are displayed using ls -l, showing a 10-character string like:


-rw-r--r--  1 user group  1234 Apr 3 10:00 file.txt
Breaking it down:

-rw-r--r--

- → Type (- for file, d for directory)

rw- → Owner has read and write permissions.

r-- → Group has read-only permission.

r-- → Others have read-only permission.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

For directories:

drwxr-xr-x  1 user group  4096 Apr 3 10:00 mydir

d → Directory

rwx → Owner has read, write, and execute permissions.

r-x → Group can read and execute but cannot modify.

r-x → Others can read and execute but cannot modify.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Default Permissions (Umask)

Files: Default is rw-r--r-- (644) because execute (x) is removed.

Directories: Default is rwxr-xr-x (755) because directories need execute (x) for navigation.

You can check the current umask (which determines default permissions) using:

Common umask values:

022 → Files: 644, Directories: 755

666-022=644
777-022=755

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Identify Large Files and Directories
Remove Unnecessary Files
Clear System Logs              sudo truncate -s 0 /var/log/syslog  sudo echo "" > /var/log/syslog
